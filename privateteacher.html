				Online courses focusing on speaking skills
			</h3>
			<p class="editable">
				Written French and spoken French are very different. Spoken French is the hardest to master, you can't learn it with books, articles or YouTube videos. The only way to train for it is to practice it everyday with other French Speakers. This is why we organize everyday online sessions of "French Corners" where Native speakers and French learners can talk in French about various topics. For beginners, we organize some "SÃ©ances d'entraide" where volunteers can help learners using their native language or English if they don't have yet the level to join French Corners.
